Changes in the version 1.29.2-exp1
==================================

This version contains an experimental rendering engine. New features include:

- Proper 7x8 pixel characters in text modes
- Fonts are used exactly as taken from system ROMs
- Real-time NTSC TV simulation in native Apple modes

Known issues:

- New graphics is displayed in a separate window, in addition to the original
  graphics implementation.
- 80-column Apple text modes will also display in NTSC simulation mode which
  looks really bad--as it would on an actual NTSC TV-set. There is currently no
  way to switch to pixel-precise rendering on demand.
- Combined graphics modes and partial page animations don't work for Apple2e,
  as seen on the Test Drive title screen.
- Not all fonts are replaced with ROM versions. Some systems will display text
  inverted and flipped.

Good luck!
