Changes in the version 1.24
===========================

Fixed some minor bugs.
Improved simulation of Shugart (ES-5088) drive (including rotation speed measurement).
Now Shugard disks, in both .nib and .dsk formats, may be copied/formatted correctly in IKP / Sprite (format nibs only) OS.
Added new sample system "Teletext".
Added two new tools: genimage and fdd1extr.

Good luck!
