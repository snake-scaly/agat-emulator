Changes in the version 1.21
===========================

Added basic implementation of Acorn Atom system.
This version implements both standard (2K RAM) and extended configurations (12K RAM) as well as custom 40K RAM configuration.
All video modes, both mono and color are implemented;
Two examples of ROMs are included with emulator (integer and floating point Basic).

Good luck!
