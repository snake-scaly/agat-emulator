* Specify if emulated systems should continue to run in background (without focus to window);
* Enable or disable sound effects for floppy drives;
* Enable or disable new internal debugger;
* Specify disassembly mode in the debugger;
* Select one of two possible screen update algorithms: "Synchronous update" to fully simulate video memory or "Synchronous update off" to increase performance on slow machines.

Also this version of Agat Emulator contains internal debugger, compatible by commands with original System Monitor.
To enable debugger, select appropriate checkbox in global settings window, then press F8 key during emulation (or select context menu item).
To close debugger, enter "Q" command.
To get short help message, enter "?" command.

Changes in the version 1.19
=============================

Version 1.19 contains implementation of CMS SCSI card.
This SCSI card was compatible with all models of Apple II.
SCSI emulation module allows to connect up to 3 virtual hard drives with specified SCSI bus ids.
Each drive with size larger than 32MB (maximum ProDOS size) will be divided to several logical partitions.
Only two of logical devices will be available to use from ProDOS.
To specify which partitions will be available to ProDOS, press left Alt key during system startup as it was with original CMS card.
This release contains example of 64MB SCSI disk with all ProDOS, Basic and hardware utilities for CMS card.
Second logical partition of this disk was formatted as empty ProDOS volume /PART2.

To create your own SCSI disk image, just specify non-existing file name in controller configuration interface, format your new device by CMS.SYSTEM utility (low-level format) and create new ProDOS volume by FILER utility.

Default system assignments:
	.DSK, .NIB - Apple ][ (for English users),
			Agat-9 (for Russian users)
	.AIM - Agat-9

To change default system configuration settings just edit following systems in emulator:
	"(3) Apple ][ Plus" - for Apple ][
