=============================

Improved emulation of TEAC drive. Now it shows true rotation period 200 ms in speed tests.

Fixed keyboard emulation code for Pravetz 8A.

Changes in the version 1.20
===========================

New configuration window gives advanced control over emulation of all systems:
* Specify if it is necessary to start systems in full-screen mode or in windowed (default);
* Specify if emulated systems should continue to run in background (without focus to window);
* Enable or disable sound effects for floppy drives;
* Enable or disable new internal debugger;
* Specify disassembly mode in the debugger;
* Select one of two possible screen update algorithms: "Synchronous update" to fully simulate video memory or "Synchronous update off" to increase performance on slow machines.

Also this version of Agat Emulator contains internal debugger, compatible by commands with original System Monitor.
To enable debugger, select appropriate checkbox in global settings window, then press F8 key during emulation (or select context menu item).
To close debugger, enter "Q" command.
To get short help message, enter "?" command.

Good luck!
