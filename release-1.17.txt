Changes in the version 1.17
===========================

Added support for command line execution with different System Configurations and Disk Images.
Implemented ability for installer to automatically register disk image types (.DSK, .NIB, .AIM).

So now it is possible to run your favourite game with a single click!

If you want to choose one of three basic configurations (Agat-7, Agat-9, Apple ][), you may right-click on the image file in Windows Explorer and simply choose which system this image for.

Default system assignments:
	.DSK, .NIB - Apple ][ (for English users),
			Agat-9 (for Russian users)
	.AIM - Agat-9

To change default system configuration settings just edit following systems in emulator:
	"(3) Apple ][ Plus" - for Apple ][
	"(1) IKP-7" - for Agat-7
	"(2) IKP-9" - for Agat-9

Good luck!
